          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mb-4">The Foundation of Successful Tutoring</h2>
          <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-6">
            Strong relationships are the foundation of successful tutoring. When students and parents trust and connect with their tutor, learning becomes more effective, enjoyable, and sustainable. These relationships extend beyond academic achievement to create lasting positive impacts on students' lives.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mb-4">Building Trust with Students</h2>

          <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-6">
            Establish a welcoming, non-judgmental atmosphere where students feel comfortable making mistakes and asking questions. Show genuine interest in their thoughts, concerns, and learning goals. This foundation of safety encourages risk-taking and honest communication.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-neutral-900 mb-3">Consistency and Reliability</h3>
          <p className="text-neutral-700 mb-6">
            Be consistent in your approach, expectations, and communication. Students thrive when they know what to expect from their tutor. Reliability in scheduling, preparation, and follow-through builds trust and demonstrates your commitment to their success.
